## Kim 2014

This download contains the BD2009, BD2013, and BLIND datasets from
[Dataset size and composition impact the reliability of performance benchmarks for peptide-MHC binding predictions](http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-15-241).

BD2013 (augmented with more recent data from IEDB) are used to train the production
MHCflurry models. BD2009 and BLIND are useful for performing validation on held-out data.


## Abelin et al. Immunity 2017

This download contains the peptides identified in
[Mass Spectrometry Profiling of HLA-Associated Peptidomes in Mono-allelic Cells Enables More Accurate Epitope Prediction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28228285).
