Abstract
Motivation: Antigen-specific T-cell immune responses against peptides derived from missense gene mutations have been shown to facilitate immunosurveillance and cancer control. These responses are induced by binding between missense mutant peptides and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins, encoded by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles.  Using MHCFlurry can predict peptides’ binding affinity to human HLA-A and HLA-B alleles, rendering promising vaccine targets.

Results: On the missense mutated tumor peptide dataset with binding affinity score less than 50nM that are functionally relevant in the Cancer Genome Project, we compute the binding affinity between the tumor peptides and HLA-A0201 and HLA-B0702. Then, we predict which missense mutated tumor peptide has the largest impact on HLA-A0201 and HLA-B0702. 



The mchFlurry package is attached in the MHCFlurry Folder.

The code for the project is found in ECBME4060_final_jupyter.ipynb.
